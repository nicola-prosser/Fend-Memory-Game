## Overview
The memory game was the third project required for the nanodegree. The code for the shuffle function was provided by Udacity. The aim of the game is to match the symbols in the fewest moves possible.

The game includes shuffling the deck randomly with each restart, adding and removing classes to flip the cards when clicked, comparing the classes to see if they match and either flipping the cards back over or changing the colour to indicate a match. The game also has a timer, a score out of three stars, a move counter and a modal which is prompted when all cards are matched.

## Gameplay

To win the game you must successfully match all the icons. The cards begin face down, when the first click takes place the timer starts and the game has begun. Find each pair of icons in the fewest moves possible.

Thank you to fellow student, Yahya Elharony, who took part in the Study Jam on the 19/4/18, he explained a lot of the features in the code which helped me understand. He has also been very patient and aswered many of my questions.
